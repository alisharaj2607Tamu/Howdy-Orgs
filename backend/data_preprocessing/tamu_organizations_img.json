The 24 hours of lemons is an endurance race that lasts 24 hours. The catch is that each car has to be worth less than 500 dollars in order to compete (not including safety equipment such as brakes, wheels, tires, fireproof suits, etc.). We also hope to compete in other possible motorsport challenges such as the ChampCar Race, World Racing League and the Grassroots Motorsports Racing $2000 challenge. Aggie Lemon Racing is open to anyone in the College Station/Bryan area, with or without experience. The only thing we ask is that our members are dedicated to pursuing our end goals.

The REACH Project provides these community members with the resources required to acquire the skills and assets needed to achieve financial self-sufficiency, build transgenerational wealth, and prevail over the obstacles preventing them from achieving their fullest potential. It aims to do this in three sectors; health, education, and housing-- all of which are areas of life in which many of our contracted workers feel gaps. Within 5 years, The REACH Project plans to implement an affordable housing village with all of these services on site for any worker or community member to benefit from. Our goal as a student organization is to provide the manpower and variety of experience to help this to happen, ultimately aiming to empower as many people in our community as possible.",

Members of FRUGAL would use frugal means to produce these items that will be distributed. As the chief student representative of the organization, I would share my knowledge of couponing at local stores such as CVS to purchase pads, tampons, wet wipes, and underwear for very minimal prices (less than $1). This not only provides support for the organization, but it allows members to form new skills that will be helpful throughout college and beyond. Additionally, this organization would have continuing education experiences to learn about period poverty and interact with those experiencing it first-hand. Lastly, members will learn (possibly from guest speakers) about the health risks involved in ineffective use of feminine hygiene products (such as toxic shock syndrome).",

The Human Environmental Animal Team is committed to making a difference in all areas of service. Texas A&M H.E.A.T. chapter was founded in the spring of 2013 by Jacob Alpuerto. Since then, our chapter has grown to include a variety of students, each with a very unique background and a passion for making the world better. Even as our chapter continues to grow, there remains a place for everyone in H.E.A.T. At Texas A&M University, H.E.A.T. is a hardworking group that wants to better the world and affect positive change through volunteering and educating our peers. This organization allows us to take part in projects we care about, meet new people, and to be a part of something important. As a member of H.E.A.T., you get to make friendships that grow to feel like family, connections throughout the Aggie community, and change in the lives of those that we work with and for. It's not only rewarding but really fun! Some of our favorite projects include building ramps for people in need, working at food banks, cleaning up litter both locally and on beaches, and volunteering with a variety of animal rescues and sanctuaries that work with wolfdogs, tigers, reptiles and amphibians, and companion animals. Our goals for the upcoming year include increasing membership numbers and participation, improving our relationships with each other through more socials, and expanding our outreach to establish new projects with new organizations. If you would like us to help you with a project near the Bryan/College Station area, please reach out to one of our executives or contact us at heattamu@gmail.com",

        "description": "Our purpose is to serve Indian graduate students (alumni, current, & incoming) and their families at Texas A&M University. We are an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students on-campus at Texas A&M University. Our student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These students come from varied backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives: 1) Advocacy : Many Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the pressures of university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, IGSA works with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community. 2) Networking : There is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA offers a students a platform to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging. 3) Mentoring : Mentorship at the departmental level is crucial for the success of our graduate students. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGSA has departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives. The availability of mentors will help the students absorb core Aggie values, which, along with traditional Indian values, which will help the graduate students become healthy and successful Aggies.",

Established as an interest group in 2016, at the Texas A&M College of Medicine, this newly-revamped organization strives to include people from all areas of higher education and to equip them with invaluable learning tools applicable to public health and global health initiatives. This opportunity for interprofessionalism and networking makes IGPHS unique from most student organizations on campus. Throughout the school year, we venture on medical and health mission trips, both locally and internationally, where basic healthcare services are provided to underserved populations in developing countries and marginalized communities. Prior to any outreach event, the professional student representatives of IGPHS host multiple training sessions in which fundamental screening procedures and public health skills are taught to graduate and undergraduate members. No experience is required. This provides aspiring healthcare professionals with substantial learning and mentoring opportunities to prepare for health initiatives across all boundaries. To emphasize interprofessionality, we also host meetings involving guest speakers, with academic and/or clinical backgrounds, in global and public health. Additionally, an abundance of community outreach and fundraising opportunities is available for members of IGPHS. Through philanthropy and humanitarian efforts, members will become enriched and empowered to cultivate their roles as future servant leaders. Health care is one of the most fundamental needs of a human being. When people do not have access to these services or related resources, health complications become more predominant and the overall quality of life is reduced. Here at IGPHS, we see the value of every person's life; we strive to be a catalyst for positive change by bridging the current gaps between healthcare and populations who need it. The mission of IGPHS is to improve health, to ensure survival, and to enable the well-being of vulnerable populations through empathetic and transformative actions that connect health care services to medically underserved and impoverished communities across local, national, and international boundaries. Together, as a society, we have the power and potential to make a difference in the lives of others by working collaboratively towards improving population health.",

They entrust and give themselves completely to the Immaculata with a view to their own sanctification and in order to collaborate in Mary\u2019s maternal mission to direct the heart of each person toward Christ. On Calvary, Christ Himself accomplishes the first act of entrusting, giving the disciple to Mary and Mary to the disciple (cf. Jn 19:25-27), 1 and thus the life of the disciple, from that moment, is characterized by her maternal presence (cf. RM [Redemptoris Mater] 45). One of the ways in which the special entrusting of a person to the Mother of Christ has been practiced and expressed within the history of the Church is that of Saint Maximilian Kolbe. He lived that vital, dynamic relationship with Mary in a unique way, understood as becoming \u201cchanged into her, transubstantiated into her\u201d (KW 508), in order to reach a more perfect union with Christ and in order to point Him out to all people, as she did (cf. Jn 2:5).",

The sisters of Sigma Phi Omega are strongly committed to serving the community, as well. Our official National Philanthropy is domestic violence. In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our organization hosts a week of anti-domestic violence activities. However, this does not limit us to just one cause, our mission is much wider with a variety of other community service projects.

We provide teams with funding, lab space, equipment, and guidance from clinical, technical, and entrepreneurial advisors.

We will accomplish this by determining an organization speed record with a semester-long development of an RC aircraft that will continue to be surpassed in succeeding semesters. In doing this we intend to gain the experience of leadership and the knowledge of what it means to develop an aircraft in a team environment. This simple goal gives engineers nearly unlimited design freedom (think of the analogy of F1 without regulation). With this, we hope to pose propulsion-specific speed challenges whether if it is a speed record with a single propeller, multi-propeller, turbojet, or rocket engine. This challenge requires the engineers at SSFE to push the limits of their engines and designs.",

SEDS provides an excellent environment in which people may obtain access to many sources of information including speakers, tours, films, and discussion groups. Astronomy observing trips and tours of local space facilities also play a significant role in the life of many SEDS members. SEDS members often take the knowledge they have gained and use it to influence the future of the space program. Students at several chapters have played major roles in organizing large conferences and have established important contacts with members of the space community. Others have helped increase public awareness of the benefits of space exploration by offering presentations to local primary and secondary schools as well as universities. The Texas A&M chapter is one of the most active SEDS chapters on both the national and local levels. Several of our members are current or former national SEDS executive board members. Members have been involved in the International Year of Astronomy, AIAA, the Space Frontier Foundation, The Planetary Society, and many other space-related organizations. Our SEDS chapter has also competed and placed in several engineering design competitions. SEDS is also actively involved in planning and helping with Yuri's Night Houston. Our chapter also hosts social nights where our members get together and play space-themed games or watch space-themed movies. Our chapter also tours SpaceX, Johnson Space Center, Southwest Research Institute, and many other space-themed companies on a regular basis. Our SEDS chapter also always sends students to the annual national SEDS conference, SpaceVision. Anyone with a passion for space is welcome, regardless of major affiliation!",

Currently, freshmen seeking to learn about a particular career in-depth have to join clubs or programs dedicated to that field, essentially forcing them to commit to that profession without full knowledge. By contrast, Trailblazers aims to give young business students all the knowledge they need up front, allowing them to make the best possible decision as to their chosen pathway. Supplying this broad swathe of information at an early stage is crucial, as many of the most sought-after business roles (consulting, banking, etc.) are primarily broken into via internships that open soon after one\u2019s freshman year. As such, it is nowadays almost a necessity that business students with goals to enter competitive fields have their career pathways set by the end of their first year. Hopefully, with the influence of Trailblazers, more Texas A&M students can find their perfect path at the right time, setting them up to land top-quality roles and elevating the standing of Mays Business School for years to come.",

We will recruit dedicated students focusing on pre-health care professions such as pre-nursing, pre-dental, pre-pharmacy, pre-medical, and pre-veterinary. Along with providing free basic medical, dental, and veterinary care, students will visit several communities and participate in community projects that aim to better the quality of life in these impoverished areas. All of these activities, and more, will give the students a better understanding and appreciation of the culture.

Interns will fundraise for medications and supplies prior to the trip abroad. While in-country, interns will assist the veterinarians with performing physical exams, giving vaccines, performing surgeries, deworming animals and assessing general health and well-being. All intern activities are under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian. This is an intensive internship, valuable to future veterinarians, veterinary technicians and other future healthcare providers as well as those interested in seeing what it is like to work in a developing country. The internship is focused on giving interns a variety of experiences, deepening their understanding of the veterinary field, and broadening their global view.",

As this growth continues, so does the need to ensure that animation content represents the world as it should be - a world where women are equally represented, both behind the scenes and on the screen, to move culture forward. Women are known for the ability to value, tap into, and use our creativity and abilities to influence. And women's influence in animation is one that rounds out the industry, grows revenues, and contributes to that forward cultural momentum. Student chapters of WIA allow for programming and relationships that aids in demystifying the path from school to industry.",

As the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement, the Foundation introduces thousands of American youth to these principles. We accomplish our mission by providing essential conferences, seminars, educational materials, internships, and speakers to young people across the country. In 2011, Young America's Foundation unified with Young Americans for Freedom, which serves as the Foundation's chapter affiliate on college and high school campuses across the country. Founded by William F. Buckley, Jr. and a group of young conservatives in 1961 at his home in Sharon, Connecticut, Young Americans for Freedom today promotes to youth the principles of limited government, individual freedom, free enterprise, a strong national defense, and traditional values, as outlined in the Sharon Statement. The chapters accomplish this by participating in a wide range of campus initiatives, such as the 9/11: Never Forget Project, Freedom Week, and the GPA Redistribution Contest, among others; and by hosting prominent conservative speakers",
