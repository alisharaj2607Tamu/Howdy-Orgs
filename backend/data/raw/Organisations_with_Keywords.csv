We are an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students on-campus at Texas A&M University. Our student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These students come from varied backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives: 1) Advocacy : Many Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the pressures of university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, IGSA works with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community. 2) Networking : There is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA offers a students a platform to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging. 3) Mentoring : Mentorship at the departmental level is crucial for the success of our graduate students. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGSA has departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives. The availability of mentors will help the students absorb core Aggie values, which, along with traditional Indian values, which will help the graduate students become healthy and successful Aggies.",igsa@igsa.tamu.edu,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/org/igsa,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/images/tamu-logo-white.png,Research,Academic,Development

Interprofessional Global & Public Health Society,"The Interprofessional Global & Public Health Society (IGPHS) is a diverse organization; including students from the Texas A&M Health Science Center Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and the School of Public Health; as well as undergraduates interested in the health field at Texas A&M University. Established as an interest group in 2016, at the Texas A&M College of Medicine, this newly-revamped organization strives to include people from all areas of higher education and to equip them with invaluable learning tools applicable to public health and global health initiatives. This opportunity for interprofessionalism and networking makes IGPHS unique from most student organizations on campus. Throughout the school year, we venture on medical and health mission trips, both locally and internationally, where basic healthcare services are provided to underserved populations in developing countries and marginalized communities. Prior to any outreach event, the professional student representatives of IGPHS host multiple training sessions in which fundamental screening procedures and public health skills are taught to graduate and undergraduate members. No experience is required. This provides aspiring healthcare professionals with substantial learning and mentoring opportunities to prepare for health initiatives across all boundaries. To emphasize interprofessionality, we also host meetings involving guest speakers, with academic and/or clinical backgrounds, in global and public health. Additionally, an abundance of community outreach and fundraising opportunities is available for members of IGPHS. Through philanthropy and humanitarian efforts, members will become enriched and empowered to cultivate their roles as future servant leaders. Health care is one of the most fundamental needs of a human being. When people do not have access to these services or related resources, health complications become more predominant and the overall quality of life is reduced. Here at IGPHS, we see the value of every person's life; we strive to be a catalyst for positive change by bridging the current gaps between healthcare and populations who need it. The mission of IGPHS is to improve health, to ensure survival, and to enable the well-being of vulnerable populations through empathetic and transformative actions that connect health care services to medically underserved and impoverished communities across local, national, and international boundaries. Together, as a society, we have the power and potential to make a difference in the lives of others by working collaboratively towards improving population health.",tamuigphs@gmail.com,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/org/igphs,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/images/tamu-logo-white.png,Health,Public,Igphs

Militia of the Immaculata,"The purpose of the MI, universal like its mission, consists of collaborating in the conversion and sanctification of all, thus obtaining the greatest glory of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity (cf. LG [Lumen Gentium] 69). MI members live their own baptismal consecration by welcoming the gift of the Redeemer from the Cross: “Behold your Mother” (Jn 19:27). They entrust and give themselves completely to the Immaculata with a view to their own sanctification and in order to collaborate in Mary’s maternal mission to direct the heart of each person toward Christ. On Calvary, Christ Himself accomplishes the first act of entrusting, giving the disciple to Mary and Mary to the disciple (cf. Jn 19:25-27), 1 and thus the life of the disciple, from that moment, is characterized by her maternal presence (cf. RM [Redemptoris Mater] 45). One of the ways in which the special entrusting of a person to the Mother of Christ has been practiced and expressed within the history of the Church is that of Saint Maximilian Kolbe. He lived that vital, dynamic relationship with Mary in a unique way, understood as becoming “changed into her, transubstantiated into her” (KW 508), in order to reach a more perfect union with Christ and in order to point Him out to all people, as she did (cf. Jn 2:5).",militia.immaculata.TAMU@gmail.com,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/org/2717,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/images/tamu-logo-white.png,Religious,Faith,Community

Trailblazers,"The purpose of Trailblazers is to educate freshmen business students on the various types of highly sought-after careers they can pursue as well as provide them with honest perspectives on what it is like to work in and recruit for those careers. Currently, freshmen seeking to learn about a particular career in-depth have to join clubs or programs dedicated to that field, essentially forcing them to commit to that profession without full knowledge. By contrast, Trailblazers aims to give young business students all the knowledge they need up front, allowing them to make the best possible decision as to their chosen pathway. Supplying this broad swathe of information at an early stage is crucial, as many of the most sought-after business roles (consulting, banking, etc.) are primarily broken into via internships that open soon after one’s freshman year. As such, it is nowadays almost a necessity that business students with goals to enter competitive fields have their career pathways set by the end of their first year. Hopefully, with the influence of Trailblazers, more Texas A&M students can find their perfect path at the right time, setting them up to land top-quality roles and elevating the standing of Mays Business School for years to come.",,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/org/trailblazers,https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/images/tamu-logo-white.png,Business,Trailblazers,Freshmen
